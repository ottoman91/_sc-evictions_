## Section 1
In this analysis, we would like to find out the city in South Carolina which had the most evictions. 

First, let's read the data about the evictions from cities in South Carolina.

```{r}
city_dataset <- read_rds(here::here(dataset_link))
glimpse(city_dataset)
```

```{r}
city_dataset %>% 
  arrange(desc(evictions)) %>% 
  top_n(1, evictions)
```

The city of North Charleston in South Carolina had the most evictions, at 3660.
